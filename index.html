  <h1>About</h1>
  <h3></h3>
  <p> We have made multiple decisions while deciding on an aesthetic for our website. We spent time sifting through images to find something that reflected our vision for the band. After choosing our first image we decided we needed a different image that was more connected to our vision. This new image was actually created by Natalie who used spectrogram imaging.

	We came to understanding that the CSS has a greater effect on the style and visuals of the site while the html has a greater effect on the content of the site.

  We worked extensively to include each member of the group and emphasize their different skill sets. </p>
